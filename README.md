# minekeeper

How to run: visit minekeeper.onrender.com/host.html and (without closing the host.html tab!) paste the given link into a new tab to start a lobby.

Rules: 
- You can reveal one square, place one flag, and move one mine per turn.
- To do any of these things, click the appropriate mode button at the bottom of the screen.
- Revealing squares and placing flags works the same as traditional minesweeper.
   - If you reveal a square with a mine under it, you lose.
- To move a mine, click any square you think has a mine under it and click another destination square to transfer the mine.
   - If the destination square already has a mine, you lose.
- Win if your opponent steps on a mine or if, when both of you have revealed all of the safe squares and flagged all of the mines, you have more accurate flags placed.
